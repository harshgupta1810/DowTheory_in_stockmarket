## Introduction
The Dow Theory Stock Trend Analyzer is a Python script that applies the principles of Dow Theory to analyze stock trends and provide insights into the prevailing market direction. Dow Theory is one of the foundational principles of technical analysis in the stock market and focuses on identifying trends and potential reversals in stock prices.

## What is Dow Theory Stock Trend Analyzer?
The Dow Theory Stock Trend Analyzer is a powerful tool that utilizes the principles of Dow Theory to analyze stock trends. Dow Theory is based on the concept that stock prices move in trends and that these trends can be analyzed to make more informed trading decisions. The analyzer uses historical stock price data and calculates moving averages to identify the prevailing trend in the market.

## Installation
To use the Dow Theory Stock Trend Analyzer, you will need Python and the required libraries installed on your system. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Install Python: Download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2. Install necessary libraries: Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command:
   ```
   pip install pandas yfinance matplotlib plotly mplfinance
   ```

## Usage
1. Import the required libraries and the `analyze_stock_trends` function into your Python script.

2. Prepare historical stock price data for the specific stock using Yahoo Finance (yfinance) and historical price data for a market index.

3. Define the `moving_average_period` (default: 50) and `volume_threshold` (default: 1.5) based on your preference.

4. Call the `analyze_stock_trends` function, passing the stock data and index data as arguments, along with the optional moving average period and volume threshold.

5. The function will return an indication of the prevailing trend based on the Dow Theory principles and whether the volume confirms the trend.

## Configuration
